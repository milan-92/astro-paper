  Creating a little social network for conference attendees is the core of Conference King. Getting this right is what will help build the relationships between attendees. Conferences are all about building relationships.

The social connection aspect of Conference King is the core of the product, as far as I'm concerned. This is the thing I think I've never seen executed as well as it should be in other conference apps.

But as we are building an MVP we can't cover all the features that we want just yet. For now all we need is a simple way for users to edit their profile, and to browse other attendees' profiles.

There will be four profile types:

1. Attendee (with VIP badge for VIP attendees)
2. Speaker
3. Sponsor
4. Organizer

Users will not be creating their own accounts in the MVP. They will be grabbed from the Tickettailor records that VNF has of each guest. So they only need to login.
