description: "I hate the marketing buzzword AI. Too many worthless startups are using the word AI to get funding. Or just because. I'll be using the term LLM (Large Language Model) instead. This is what we mean by AI anyway. In a few years the word AI will fall out of marketing speak as it is a loaded buzzword."

'AI' has been around since 1997 - when <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_Blue_versus_Garry_Kasparov" target="_blank">Deep Blue beat Garry Kasparov in chess</a>. I would call a computer beating the world champion in the deepest strategy game of all time - Artificial Intelligence.

AI is not new technology. And AI is just a marketing term anyway. It doesn't actually mean anything in particular. What we are really talking about in 2025 when we talk about AI is LLMs (Large Language Models), or less often, automations.

## What is a Large Language Model?

No, LLMs are not the four horsemen of the apocalypse. And they won't take your job and usher in a new age of luxury gay space communism with universal basic income - you'll still have to keep working and creating value with either your brain or your hands to get paid, unfortunately.

Yes, OpenAI, the company behind chatGPT - has built an incredible piece of software, that's undeniable. And the other competing LLMs are also incredible pieces of software - I'm using claude in my daily work, helping me write this article and also code Conference King. It's replaced googling and copy pasting stackoverflow and documentation for answers and instead I can just ask the LLM to do it for me.

LLMs are just like google search on steroids in a way. They are a tool that you can use to query the repository of information that is on the internet (that was what google does) - but then it extends that by generating an answer based on your query. It doesn't think, and AGI is not a thing. It's just a marketing term by the greatest marketers of our day - OpenAI.

So yeah. I'm not jumping on the band wagon with Conference King's marketing materials. I'm not using the word AI. I'm using the word LLM, if I do implement their usage in features.
