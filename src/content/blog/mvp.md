I had coffee today in Da Nang with Markos & Dimitris, the organizers of Vietnam Nomad Fest. They're interested in trialling the product at VNF - I also applied to present this journey on stage as as speaker at VNF as well. So pressure is on - if Conference King sucks at VNF I'll have to answer on stage to the wrath of an unhappy crowd. Let's hope they don't throw tomatoes at me.

From the time of writing there are 62 days left until <a href="https://www.vietnamnomadfest.com" target="_blank">the Vietnam Nomad Fest</a>. So here's a nice deadline to get a basic MVP for Conference King ready. I can go on the website anytime I want to watch the clock tickdown in time to launch this MVP. It's good to have some fire under your feet to get things done.

I also had a video call with Jan from <a href="https://nomads-in-paradise.com/" target="_blank">Nomads in Paradise</a>, he's currently in Germany.

From these conversations I decided on these basic featuresets to get Conference King ready for VNF.

## Core Features for Conference King MVP

1. **Schedule Management**
   - The event schedule will be created by the organizer and will be visible to all attendees. 
   - It will be conveniently navigable during the conference, real time updating so that you can see what's happening now and what's next.

2. **Attendee Networking**
   - Attendee profiles, with what interests they have during the conference. Also will have their contact details so they can connect off the app
   - Attendees will be able to edit the app profile with their interests and contact details
   - Depending on your interests as an attendee perhaps the Schedule will somehow recommend or filter sessions for you. A For you vs All sessions view perhaps? Mirroring Tiktok & Twitter feeds? We'll develop this further as I create a Figma / Canva wireframe demo.

Here's a basic timeline that will probably be completely wrong but hey it will be nice to look back on it as things develop.

## Development Timeline

- **Jan 10-24**: Designing a wireframe/mockup for the app & choosing a tech stack
- **Jan 25-Feb 7**: Schedule management features  
- **Feb 8-21**: Attendee profiles
- **Feb 22-Mar 6**: Announcements and notifications
- **Mar 7-13**: Mockup testing of VNF before the conference. 

The goal is to have something functional ready for Vietnam Nomad Fest to test with real users. I'm hoping the real time scheduling is a wow factor that will convince other organizers to adopt the system - there will be many other event organizers in attendance at VNF.
