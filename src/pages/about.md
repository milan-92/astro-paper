Hey there! - I'm Milan MilutinoviÄ‡. Thanks for taking the time to check out my blog. Every word here was written with you in mind! So I hope you find value and enjoy reading these words as much as I value writing them for you.

I'm going to write a little Biography here at 32 years old about myself - I've lived a fairly adventurous, and inordinary life - and I rarely give myself the time to stop and reflect on it, so allow me to indulge in some of my memories and life story with you for a few moments. 

I was born in 1992 during the Yugoslav wars - in the geographical sense, I was born as far away as possible from the war, but this crisis was very close to our family. I was born in Australia - the lucky country - but my parents were born and raised in Yugoslavia, a place that was consumed by chaos and falling apart as I was learning how to speak my mother tongue.

My childhood and teenage years were spent in a suburb called Springvale in Melbourne, Australia. Over 90% of the population of the area was Vietnamese - which is fitting because I am writing this in Da Nang, Vietnam - where I have been living as a Digital Nomad for the past 6 weeks.

Like most teenagers I had strong feelings of disillusionment and isolation. So I fell into listening to a lot of music, searching for a way outside of myself. Somehow I stumbled upon this Howlin' Wolf song on YouTube. I had no idea what the blues was.

 I didn't like it. Howlin Wolf's music was strange to me at first. I thought people would think I was weird for listening to it. But something about it made me curious. After a while I began to appreciate it. 

Howlin Wolf seemed so raw and powerful. And very authentically masculine, which I found very appealing as a shy teenager. There was also a pain to this blues that I could relate to. Maybe the blues could help me turn my pain into power? I thought if I could learn how to sing and play guitar and write songs to express myself - I could let all the pain out of my heart, and maybe conquer the world at the same time as well.

So I spent most of my early 20's trying to master that real old authentic blues. And instead of being an indie hacker I started an indie band. An indie blues band which I called The New Savages.

There is a trap that many indie bands create for themselves - they convince themselves that seeking a profit and creating a sustainable business from music is somehow a betrayal to living life authentically as an artist. 

My goal was to find myself authentically as an artist, and then to project that self-knowing power through the music I create. I wasn't interested in making money, I was interested in the artist's journey - the spiritual quest.

But it was obvious very quickly that the momentum of artistic progression and exploration was dependent on the momentum of the business of The New Savages. And I knew no one was going to give me a career in music, so, begrudgingly, I began my entrepreneurial journey as well.

It's amazing the skills you learn while self managing and being the frontman of a band. It's funny because alot of people on first meeting would ask me "Music, that's cool. So what do you really do?".

Showmanship, Songwriting, Performing, Storytelling - and most of all - learning how to authentically be myself. For three years I had
