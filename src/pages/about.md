My name is Milan. Nice to meet you.

A long time ago I was an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv7BS9yV2Rg" target="_blank">indie blues musician</a> in Australia and I started my software career by hardcoding basic websites for other indie musicians. Eventually I started building more complex tools and software for other people.

Building software for other people has allowed me to travel the world as a Digital Nomad, meet amazing people, and learn a lot about myself. It led me to attending many Digital Nomad conferences and events around the world - the people I met at these conferences greatly changed my perspective on life. 

These great events and meeting all these people - I was inspired to put my own conference together in <a href="https://www.nisnomadweek.com/" target="_blank">Niš, Serbia</a>. A little city in Serbia that I've been calling home for the past few years - the city my parents were born and raised in before they bought a one way ticket to Australia.

Having attended many conferences, and organizing my own - and being largely disappointed by the experience of the conference apps - I decided to build my own. To make sure event organizers and attendees get the best experience possible. The working title for the app is Conference King.

Inspired by <a href="https://nathanbarry.com/starting-web-app-challenge/" target="_blank">Nathan Barry's famous build in public challenge</a>, which was the beginning of what is <a href="https://kit.com/" target="_blank">Kit.com</a> today - I'll be building Conference King in public.

I'm writing this blog to order my own thinking, as a public mirror of my own journey. I hope you find value in my journey and enjoy reading these words as much as I value writing them for you.
